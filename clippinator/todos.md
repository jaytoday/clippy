## Todos and ideas

- [X] Improve the bash tool (killing processes, etc.)
- [X] Summarization
- [X] Architect subagent
- [X] Wget tool (for QA)
- [X] Browsing tool (selenium+html2text)
- [ ] Improve the QA agent (somehow...)
- [X] Using ^C to provide extra human input to the agents
- [X] Storing intermediate Taskmaster states
- [ ] Function descriptions (for the complex ones), typing, tests in architecture
- [ ] Architecture iteration: taskmaster has to ask for simplified architecture (that can be updated after) and then ask
  to update it. Maybe use git to commit intermediate versions
- [X] Picked examples for the architect
- [ ] Summarization in project summary
- [ ] Find usages or documentation of a function
- [X] Self-setup: commands to run for project summary, after writing files, to run a project
- [X] "Remember" tool
- [X] Linter warnings at Patch and Write
- [X] Better patches (just replacing lines)
- [X] Integrate ESLint
- [X] Bring back the search tool
- [ ] Maybe auto feedback in specialized agents
- [ ] Todos for Taskmaster
